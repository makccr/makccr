### What's up?
I'm a pretty small YouTuber, who really only uses GitHub to store some [dotfiles](https://github.com/makccr/dot) & [wallpapers](https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers). I do however have a few different [custom](https://github.com/makccr/disk-monitor-polybar) [polybar](https://github.com/makccr/awmp) [modules](https://github.com/makccr/pyt), and the [source code](https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io) for my personal website is easily accesible here. The site is quite simple: a static site powered by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) serving as a kind of a CMS solution for a few parts of the site, hosted here on Github Pages.
