### What's up
I'm a pretty small YouTuber, who really only uses GitHub to store some [dotfiles](https://github.com/makccr/dot) & [wallpapers](https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers). I do however have a few different custom [polybar](https://github.com/makccr/awmp) [modules](https://github.com/makccr/pyt), and the [source code](https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io) for my personal website is easily accesible here as well, if that's something you're interested in. It's for the most part, 100% CSS & HTML (and a tiny bit of JavaScript), but no frameworks, and no JS websites. It's about a simply developed and maintained as a site can possible be.
